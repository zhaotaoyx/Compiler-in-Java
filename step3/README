The provided Makefile is for ANTLR v4.
Use "make" in command line to compile.
Use "java -cp lib/antlr.jar:classes/ Micro (path of input file) > (path of output file)" in command line to run and get the result file.
Example command to run: "java -cp lib/antlr.jar:classes/ Micro testcases/input/fibonacci.micro > testcases/output/fibonacci.out"
Use "make clean" to clean the classes generated during compile process.
You need to edit your own Makefile if you're using v3 or something else.

Micro.g4 is the grammar file that you may want to edit and Micro.java is the main java program.
